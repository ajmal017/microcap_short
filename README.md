# microcap_short - Gap Up Shorting Penny Stocks

![Backtest](backtest.png)

Everybody who is interested in the micro cap or penny stock sector knows that these stocks fail most of the time. However, there are short bursts of excitement in some of them with massive upswings. Usually news fuel irrational price action and 'pump' the stock, which can happen very quickly as those stocks have often a low amount of outstanding shares and are cheap. After this 'bubble phase', these stocks often collapse creating amazing short opportunities, if only one could enter at the right time.

I explored whether one could just simply short the penny stocks which 'gap up' pre-market and then emit short signals for the market open. In principle the strategy is simple and very successful in backtesting (Fig.). However, likely flaws are the typical large bid/ask spread in these equities which is not accounted for in the backtest and that one cannot trade the market open as easily as you might think (see also https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7IPbPg_ME8 ). On top of that, there are constraints for short sellers like the unavailability of shares to borrow, which are also not included in the backtest. Overall, this strategy is also too good to be true: No efficient market would allow such a simple strategy with such high risk-adjusted returns.

The algorithm is executed on the QuantConnect platform ( www.quantconnect.com ). While the backtest does not need external information, live trading needs input as one cannot update the universe in QuantConnect during the premarket trading hours. I use AWS Lambda functions to scrape the pre-market activity from the NASDAQ website ( https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/pre-market ) and scrape the penny stocks with high activity from FinVIZ ( finviz_handler.py and nasdaq_handler.py ). All stocks, which gapped up above 2 stddev of their historical returns are ranked and shorted at the market open. QuantConnect does not allow a direct download of the files, so one has to go through Dropbox.
